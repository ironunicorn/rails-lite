# Rails Study

A homemade rails inspired server and ORM. Users can create read update and
wake up (destroy) cats with a custom RESTful API and SQLite3 ORM. The code
includes familiar methods like render, redirect, params, session, and flash
along with controller and model bases, and a router class. The ORM features
save, update, all, belongs_to, and has_many methods to round out the
functionality. The live version pairs the functionality with in depth
explanations of the running code.

This is currently a work in progress so not all explanations have been written yet.
There's also more features I want to implement to exhibit other standard rails features:

- [ ] controller's before_action method
- [ ] exhibit has_many and belongs_to in the live version.
- [ ] validates presence and uniqueness.
